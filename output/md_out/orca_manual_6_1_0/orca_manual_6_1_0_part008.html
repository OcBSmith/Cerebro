<div class='page'>
<p>It is also possible to approximate light atoms a, b (below a certain atomic number) as non-relativistic:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Unlike the one center approximation (which is also available for X2C), all nuclei are included in the potential operator ˆ V .</p>
<p>The DLU approximation can be requested via the simple input keyword !DLU-X2C . Additional options are available in the %rel block (see also Section 2.12.9):</p>
<pre><code>%rel DLU false # default -not used true # turn DLU on LightAtomThresh 0 # (default) highest atomic number treated as non-relativistic end</code></pre>
<h2>X2C Derivatives and Properties</h2>
<p>As discussed in Section 2.12.7, when computing properties with relativistic methods, derivatives need to be taken of the correct Hamiltonian, namely h + (eq (2.50)) in the X2C case. These include contributions due to the derivatives of R and X , which are often small. Therefore, it is possible to neglect them and save some computational time via the following option:</p>
<pre><code>%rel PictureChange 2 # compute the full relativistic Hamiltonian derivative 1 # neglect derivatives of R and X 0 # (default) use the non-relativistic operator end</code></pre>
<p>The same setting is applied to all properties for which the X2C correction is implemented. Currently, these are: geometric gradients, electric dipoles, quadrupoles, and polarizabilities, electric field gradients, EPR hyperfine couplings, and NMR shieldings and spin-spin couplings. For the Hessian, the X2C correction is implemented in a semi-numeric fashion. The DLU approximation is applied throughout, if requested, and reduces the computational effort dramatically. Note that for magnetic properties, the restricted magnetic balance (RMB) for the small component basis functions is used whenever GIAOs are requested (e.g. NMR shielding), while the restricted kinetic balance (RKB) is used otherwise (e.g. NMR coupling). The spin-orbit coupling integrals used for various properties only include a relativistic correction to the one-electron term, as is the case for DKH.</p>
<p>For second derivative properties whose number is proportional to the number of atoms, e.g. the DSO term of NMR couplings, first derivatives of various intermediate quantities required for the full X2C second derivative are stored on disk. The storage requirements can be reduced via the StorageLevel keyword and the missing intermediates will be recomputed on-the-fly, which of course increases the computation time.</p>
<pre><code>%rel StorageLevel 0 # do not store anything -not always available 1 # store integral derivatives 2 # 1 + derivatives of R and X (default, minimum for DLU) 3 # 2 + derivatives of L 4 # 3 + derivatives of S-tilde 5 # 4 + derivatives of D and M end</code></pre>
<h2>2.12.6 Basis Sets in Relativistic Calculations</h2>
<p>The different scalar relativistic potentials have different shapes in the core region. Consequently, each one of them requires specialized all electron basis sets that are optimized for the Hamiltonian at hand. Such basis sets have been designed, both as DKH and ZORA recontractions of the Ahlrichs and Karlsruhe basis sets for elements up to Kr (for which the original non-relativistic versions are all-electron), and as purpose-built segmented all-electron relativistically contracted (SARC) basis sets for elements beyond Kr .[50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55] For X2C calculations, the 'x2c-XVPall' basis sets and their variants are available.[57, 58] All available built-in choices are listed in the section Relativistic Basis Sets .</p>
<p>An uncontracted all-electron basis set of sufficient size will always work. Likewise, uncontracted fitting basis sets in all forms of RI calculations are always appropriate. Use the !Decontract keyword to decontract the chosen basis set and make it suitable for any relativistic Hamiltonian, as well as comparisons between them.</p>
<p>If large, uncontracted basis sets are used in scalar relativistic calculations, there is a distinct danger of variational collapse. This behavior is related to the fact that the relativistic orbitals will diverge for a point nucleus. ORCA features the Gaussian finite nucleus model of Dyall and Visscher for DKH and X2C. We recommend to always use this feature ( FiniteNuc ) in relativistic calculations (see Section 2.12.8).</p>
<p>Given the fact relativistic all-electron calculations on heavy element compounds feature very steep core basis functions, numeric integration, such as in DFT and COSX, may be challenging. ORCA features automatic procedures that adapt the integration grids for the presence of steep basis functions. However, in case you experience strange results, the numeric integration is one potential source of problem. The cure is to go to larger integration grids and, in particular, increase the radial integration accuracy ( IntAcc ).</p>
<h2>2.12.7 Picture-Change Effects</h2>
<p>Irrespective of which Hamiltonian has been used in the determination of the wave function, the calculation of properties requires some special care. This can be understood in two ways: First of all, we changed from the ordinary Schrödinger Hamiltonian to a more complicated Hamiltonian. As properties are defined as derivatives of the energy, it is clear that a new Hamiltonian will yield a new expression for the energy and thus a new and different expression for the property in question. Another way of seeing this is that through the transformation U , we changed not only the Hamiltonian but also the wave function. To obtain the property at hand as the expectation value of the property operator with the wave function, we have to make sure that property operator and wave function are actually given in the same space. This is done through a transformation of either the property operator or the wave function.</p>
<p>In any case, the difference between the non-relativistic and (quasi) relativistic property operator, evaluated over the (quasi) relativistic wave function, is called the picture-change effect . From what was said above, this is clearly not a physical effect. It describes how consistently the quasi relativistic calculation is carried out. A fully consistent calculation requires the determination of the wave function on the (quasi) relativistic level as well, as the use of the (quasi) relativistic property operator. This is obtained by enabling the PictureChange option in the %rel block:</p>
<pre><code>%rel PictureChange 1 end # or 2 - see below</code></pre>
<p>It may be that the (quasi) relativistic and non-relativistic property operator do produce similar results. In this case, a calculation with picture-change turned off ( PictureChange=0 ) may be a good approximation. This is often the case for valence shell-dominated properties, such as the eletric dipole and polarizability. On the other hand, property calculations involving operators that carry inverse powers of the electron-nucleus distance can be wildly inaccurate if picture change effects are ignored. It is therefore highly recommended to turn on picture-change in all (quasi) relativistic property calculations!</p>
<p>For DKH2, the fully consistent picture-change effects are obtained using the same transformation order for the property operator as for the one-electron Hamiltonian, i.e. setting PictureChange=2 , while with PictureChange=1 only first-order changes on the property operators are taken into account, which reduces the computational cost. However, since this is in no way a significant reduction, this choice is not recommended.</p>
<p>A similar argument applies to X2C, where PictureChange=2 is the formally correct approach and PictureChange=1 is an approximate treatment (see X2C Derivatives and Properties ).</p>
<p>By default, ORCA tries to choose the most appropriate value of the PictureChange variable depending on the requested properties, as described below (and issues a warning at the start of the output), but explicit user input is</p>
<p>always respected.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">For geometric perturbations with DKH or ZORA the one-center approximation is activated and picture-change corrections are not needed. With X2C, PictureChange=1 is chosen, because it significantly reduces the computational cost.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">For other properties, in particular core-sensitive ones (i.e. in EPR/NMR), the full picture-change correction is applied.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Certain combinations of relativistic Hamiltonian and property operator are not implemented, in which case ORCA prints a warning, or aborts entirely if picture change effects are expected to be significant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.12.8 Finite Nucleus Model</h2>
<p>Composite particles like nuclei have, as opposed to elementary particles, a certain spatial extent. While the pointcharge approximation for nuclei is in general very good in nonrelativistic calculations, in relativistic calculations it might lead to non-negligible errors. A finite-nucleus model is implemented in ORCA - the Gaussian nucleus model of Ref. [138] - and is available for DKH and X2C (but not ZORA) calculations in the ORCA program package. It is accessible from the %rel block via</p>
<p>%rel FiniteNuc true end</p>
<p>By default, this keyword is set to false . If the keyword is set to true , finite-nucleus effects are considered in the following integrals:</p>

<h2>2.13.1 The Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (C-PCM)</h2>
<p>The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) is an implementation of the conductor-like apparent surface charge methods. In these models the solute is placed in a cavity of roughly molecular shape. The solvent reaction field is described by apparent polarization charges on the cavity surface, which are in turn determined by the solute. These charges can be treated as punctual (point charges) or be modelled as spherical Gaussians [143]. The cavity in ORCA is constructed differently depending on how the charges are treated. In the case of using point charges, the cavity is generated through the GEPOL[144, 145, 146] algorithm, either as solvent-excluding surface (SES), or solvent-accessible surface (SAS). When Gaussian charges are considered, the user can choose between a scaled vdW surface or the GEPOL SES, and the charge positions are determined following a Lebedev quadrature approach. This scheme is known as Gaussian Charge Scheme[140] and more details on how to use it are given in Section Use of the Gaussian Charge Scheme .</p>
<p>Within C-PCM the molecular Hamiltonian of the isolated system is perturbed by the solvent:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where ˆ H 0 is the Hamiltonian of the isolated molecule, whereas ˆ V describes the solute - solvent interactions. The SCF procedure leads to the variational minimization of the free energy of the solute, G :</p>
<p>Using the conductor-like boundary condition the electrostatic potential can be determined by</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where V and V q i are the electrostatic potential due to the solute and to the polarization charges, ⃗ r is a point on the cavity surface, and N q is the total number of solvation charges. The vector of polarization charge can then be determined by</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where the vector V contains the electrostatic potential due to the solute at the position of the charges. The elements of the matrix A have a different functional form depending on how the charges are treated. If we use point charges:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>in which S i is the area of the surface element i , and r ij = | ⃗ r i -⃗ r j | . When Gaussian charges are considered:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Here, ζ i is the exponent of the Gaussian charge i ( i belongs to sphere I ). This quantity is calculated as ζ i = ζ /( R I √ w i ) , where R I is the radius of sphere I , w i is the weight of the Lebedev point i , and ζ is a width parameter optimized for each particular Lebedev grid [143]. On the other hand, ζ ij = ζ i ζ j / √ ζ 2 i + ζ 2 j . The function</p>
<p>F i , known as switching function, measures the contribution of the Gaussian charge i to the solvation energy. This function is calculated as</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where g ( ⃗ r i , ⃗ R J ) is the elementary switching function. In ORCA we use the improved Switching/Gaussian (ISWIG) function for g ( ⃗ r i , ⃗ R J ) proposed in ref. [147]:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>If g ( ⃗ r i , ⃗ R J ) &lt; 10 -7 the value of g is set equal to 0.</p>

<p>The parameters related to each implicit solvation method, as well as to the solvents can be more accurately defined using the %cpcm block input. A complete list of the available options are described in Complete Keyword List for the %cpcm Block .</p>
<p>The type of cavites surrounding the solute and how the solvation charges are treated in ORCA is explained in subsec-</p>
<p>tions Use of the Gaussian Charge Scheme , and Use of the Point Charge Scheme . ORCAsupports two types of solvation charge schemes: (i) the point charge scheme, (ii) the Gaussian charge scheme. The default solvation scheme from ORCA 5.0 on is the Gaussian charge scheme with a vdW-type cavity ( surfacetype vdw_gaussian ). Older ORCAversions considered surfacetype gepol_ses and the point charge scheme as defaults. So, if one wants to reproduce the results obtained with ORCA versions older than ORCA 5.0, please use the tag surfacetype gepol_ses in the %cpcm block.</p>
<p>The different charge schemes are described in the subsections Use of the Gaussian Charge Scheme , and Use of the Point Charge Scheme . The availability of the analytical gradient and Hessian for the different combinations of charge scheme and surface is shown in Table Table 2.57.</p>
<figure><figcaption><div class="caption">Table 2.57: Available type of gradients and Hessians within the C-PCM in ORCA. The tag &#x27;YES&#x27; means that the feature is implemented, and &#x27;NO&#x27; that it isn&#x27;t. For clarity, we denote by &#x27;*&#x27; the default scheme in ORCA ( surfacetype vdw_gaussian ).</div></figcaption></figure>

<p>! NOCPCM</p>
<p>This is needed, for instance, in the context of concatenated calculations using the $new_job feature, where the previous calculation involved solvation, but one wants to turn it off for the next one.</p>
<p>Note 2: As stated above, the default for C-PCM in ORCA is the Gaussian charge scheme with a vdW-type cavity. The implementation is done following ref. [140]. Hence, if C-PCM is used in ORCA calculations, one must cite this paper together with ref. [139]. Ref. [140] must also be cited if SMD, or openCOSMO-RS are requested, since these type of calculations rely on C-PCM.</p>
<h2>Use of the Gaussian Charge Scheme</h2>
<p>The Gaussian charge scheme avoids the Coulomb singularity present in conventional point charge surface element models. This approach, when applied together with a switching function, results in a smooth solvation potential and, more importantly, on smooth derivatives of this quantity with respect to external perturbations. Then, it is highly recommended to adopt this approach within the C-PCM. The Gaussian charge scheme can be used with two types of solute cavity surfaces: (1) a scaled vdW surface, (2) a solvent-excluded surface (SES). To assign the radii for the different atoms we follow the scheme proposed in ref. [147]. That is, we use Bondi radii [150] for all elements, except for hydrogen where we adopt 1.1 Å. For 16 of the main-group elements in the periodic table, where Bondi's radii are not defined, we adopt the radii proposed in ref. [151] by Mantina et al. This is the case for elements: Be, B, Al, Ca, Ge, Rb, Sr, Sb, Cs, Ba, Bi, Po, At, Rn, Fr, Ra. For the elements that are not covered neither by Bondi nor by Mantina, we consider a radius of 2 Å.</p>
<h2>· Scaled vdW cavity</h2>
<p>The Gaussian charge scheme with a scaled vdW-type cavity is now the default in ORCA, so one just needs to add the C-PCM tag in the %cpcm block in the input file. That would correspond to (although the user does not need to write that, as it is internally processed by ORCA):</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm surfacetype vdw_gaussian end</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the radius R I of atom I for the scaled vdW cavity is calculated as</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where R vdW I is the vdW radius of atom I and f scal is a scaling factor. This parameter is by default equal to 1.2, as suggested in ref. [147]. However, the user can modify its value through the scale_gauss tag in the %cpcm block in the input file. The number of C-PCM charges per atom is such that we have an approximate density of 5.0 charges/Å 2 on the surface of the cavity. This number corresponds approximately to 110 points on a hydrogen atom (110/ (4 π × 1 . 32 2 ) ≈ 5 . 0 Å -2 ). ORCA will choose then different levels of discretization (Lebedev grids) depending on the radii of the atoms. This scheme is called isodensity scheme. The threshold for the number of charges per unit of area on hydrogens and non-hydrogen atoms can be specified by the user via thresh_h and thresh_noth , respectively. Alternatively, the user can request a fixed number of Lebedev points per sphere in the cavity (independent of the radius of the sphere). This can be done via the num_leb tag. This parameter can adopt the following values: 50, 110, 194, 302, 434, 590, 770, 974, and 1202. ORCA versions older than ORCA 6.0 use this last scheme.</p>
<p>The analytical gradient, as well as the analytical Hessian are available for this solvation method.</p>
<h2>· Solvent-excluded surface</h2>
<p>The GEPOL-generated SES can be used together with the Gaussian charge scheme. In this case, the Gaussian charges are not only placed on the surface of the atomic spheres but also on the surface of the new spheres generated through the GEPOL algorithm. To use this approach we should modify the ORCA input file as follows</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm</code></pre>
<pre><code>surfacetype gepol_ses_gaussian end</code></pre>
<p>The SES is in general recommended when the solute is explicitly solvated by few solvation layers. In this case, the additional GEPOL spheres prevent the solvent to fill the space between explicit solvent molecules or between those molecules and the solute. The radius of the solvent sphere that rolls over the solute vdW-type surface to generate the SES is controlled by the keyword rsolv . This radius has a default value of 1.30 Å, but the user can change it by specifying another value for rsolv in the %cpcm block. The minimum radius for an added GEPOL sphere is controlled by rmin .</p>
<p>Neither the analytical gradient nor the analytical Hessian are available for this strategy. They should be computed numerically. Due to the interdependency between GEPOL spheres and the atoms present in our system, the analytical gradient computed using the SES does not converge as smooth as compared to that using the vdW-type cavity (see ref. [140]) and can lead to wrong minima. The Hessian is affected in the same way. Then, ORCA 6.0 does not support anymore the analytical gradient/Hessian for such surface to prevent inaccurate results.</p>
<h2>Use of the Point Charge Scheme</h2>
<p>Within this scheme, the solvation charges are treated as punctual and no switching function is used to accept/discard charges in the intersection between the spheres that form the solute cavity. These two facts lead to a discontinuous potential energy surface (numerical instabilities in the SCF energy and its derivatives). Then, the point charge scheme is not recommended within the C-PCM. If the user still wants to use this charge scheme it can be used together with two different type of surfaces for the solute cavity: (1) the SES, and (2) the SAS.</p>
<h2>· Solvent-excluded surface</h2>
<p>In the same way as for the Gaussian charge scheme with the SES, this surface is generated for the point charge scheme through the GEPOL algorithm. However, while for the case of surfacetype gepol_ses_gaussian , the surface is discretized using Lebedev-type grids, in the point charge scheme, the surface is divided in spherical triangles called 'tesserae'. The level of tesselation is controlled by the tag ndiv . The radii used for the solute atoms in order to construct the GEPOL cavity are those optimized for the COSMO-RS model[152] for H, C, N, O, F, S, Cl, Br, and I, while for the rest of elements scaled Bondi radii are used.</p>
<p>In order to use the point charge scheme with the SES, we should add the following tag in the %cpcm block:</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm surfacetype gepol_ses</code></pre>
<pre><code>end</code></pre>
<h2>· Solvent-accessible surface</h2>
<p>Here, the surface of the solute cavity is generated by following the center of a sphere with radius rsolv (representing the solvent molecule) rolling over the surface of the vdW surface of the solute. The discretization of the resulting surface is done via tesserae, as done for the SES. In order to use the point charge scheme together with the SAS, one should add the following tag in the %cpcm block:</p>
<pre><code>surfacetype gepol_sas</code></pre>
<pre><code>%cpcm end</code></pre>
<h2>· How to circumvent the numerical instabilities in the point charge scheme</h2>
<p>Numerical instabilities are implicit in the point charge scheme due to the 'punctual' nature of the charges and to the fact that no switching function is considered in the intersection between the spheres that form the solute cavity. At the same time, there is no way to predict, in advance if there will be discontinuities in the SCF energy and/or in its derivatives. However, if the user still wants to use this charge scheme, no matter with which type of surface (SES or SAS), there are two things that one can try to minimize the aforementioned problems:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Change ndiv : The parameter ndiv controls the number of triangles per sphere in the solute cavity. By changing the number of triangles, it also changes the number of triangles in the intersection between spheres and, then, this can solve those situations where two point charges get too close making the elements A ij in eq (2.53) to diverge (and the solvation charges to suddenly have very large values). However, this strategy can be a solution for a particular case, but will never ensure that for the same system with another geometry the discontinuities in the SCF energy do not show (as it does not prevent point charges to be too close from each other).</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">Increase pmin : This parameter removes those charges that are at a distance lower than pmin from each other. The default value for pmin is of 0.1 a.u. ( ≈ 0 . 0529 Å). Then, by incrasing pmin one removes all pairs of charges that are too close from each other in the intersection between the spheres. Note: Be careful when increasing pmin . Although this prevents sudden jumps in the SCF energy, it can lead to 'biasing' the solute-solvent interaction, as one is removing a significant number of charges that represent the effect of the solvent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Calculation of the free energy of solvation within the C-PCM</h2>
<p>The solvation free energy, ∆ G solv , is defined as the free energy of transfer of a solute from the gas phase to the condensed phase. This quantity can be written as (see eq 27 in ref. [140])</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>The first term, E solv ( ⃗ R v , ⃗ R l ) , corresponds to the difference between the liquid-phase expectation value of the gasphase Hamiltonian, E ( ⃗ R l ) , and the gas-phase potential energy surface E ( ⃗ R v )</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>The second term in eq (2.55) accounts for the electronic-polarization contribution to ∆ G solv and is calculated from the charges spread over the surface of the solute cavity (vdW-type or the SES). Finally, ∆ G cav is the cavitation energy, that is, the reversible work required to create a cavity inside the bulk of the solvent in order to accommodate the solute, while ∆ G disp accounts for the changes in the dispersion energy occuring when solvating the solute. The sum of these last two terms correspond to the non-electrostatic contribution, ∆ G nel , to ∆ G solv</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>In ORCA, if a system is solvated within the C-PCM (defining !CPCM(solvent name) in the input file, within either the point charge scheme or the Gaussian charge scheme) there is no 'non-electrostatic solvation contribution'</p>
<p>neither to the SCF energy, nor to its derivatives. In order to have a rough idea of the value of ∆ G nel , one can estimate this quantity through empirical equations available in the literature obtained from experimental data. For instance, ∆ G nel can be estimated from the free energy of hydration for linear-chain alkanes[153]</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where SASA is the solvent-accessible surface area. However, although eq (2.56) may give a good estimation of ∆ G nel for organic molecules in water, it is a bad approximation for non-electrostatic solvation effects when considering solvents different than water (as well as for many solutes in water). There are two alternatives to this approximation that one can adopt in order to include non-electrostatic solvation effects in ORCA calculations:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">The use of the SMD model in combination with the C-PCM (see section The SMD Solvation Model ). This is the most adopted strategy within the QM community.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">The use of Gaussian charges to compute the electrostatic contribution to ∆ G solv together with an equation for ∆ G nel calculated from the contribution of the solute atoms to the SASA.[140]</li>
</ol>
<p>Focusing on the second strategy, the cavitation energy, ∆ G cav is calculated through the equation proposed by Pierotti and Claverie.[154, 155] In this case, ∆ G cav is expanded in powers of the ratio R between the radius of the solute sphere R I and that of the solvent spheres R S . Then, the cavitation energy for the solute sphere centered at atom I reads as,</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>with y = 8 πρ S R 3 S /6 , being ρ S the density of the solvent, R = R I / R S , T the temperature and P the pressure. If we consider the solvent-accessible surface (SAS), then, the total ∆ G cav is the sum of the ∆ G cav,I weighted by a factor that depends on the exposed SASA I of sphere I</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Here, the summation over the total number of spheres ( N sph) that conform the SAS is replaced by a summation over the total number of surface elements ( N el ) in which the SAS is divided into.</p>
<p>With respect to ∆ G disp , this quantity is assumed to depend linearly on the contribution of each surface element to the SASA</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Here, the factor σ I is the atomic surface tension of the sphere I to which the surface element i belongs to.</p>
<p>This strategy, that considers eqs (2.57) and (2.58) to compute ∆ G nel assumes the use of Gaussian charges for the calculation of ∆ G el in eq (2.55). When a vdW-type cavity is used to account for electrostatic solvation effects, then the solvation approach is called GVDW_nel, while when a SES-type cavity is used we refer to the solvation approach as GSES_nel ('G' for Gaussian charges and 'nel' because of the inclusion of non-electrostatic solvation effects). Details on the GVDW_nel and GSES_nel models can be found in ref. [140].</p>
<p>The GVDW_nel and GSES_nel models have been parametrized for solutes containing H, C, N and O atoms in the following solvents: benzene, chloroform, cyclohexane, octanol, toluene and water. The parameters for the σ I atomic surface tensions in eq (2.58) together with the radius of the solvent molecules R S used to generate the SAS are provided in ref. [140]. The use of the GVDW_nel and GSES_nel is controlled by the string cds_cpcm to add in the %cpcm block. This flag should be equal to 2 within these two models (by default, when we use C-PCM together with the Gaussian Charge Scheme without non-electrostatic solvation effects, cds_cpcm is equal to 0). In order to calculate ∆ G solv for the GVDW_nel scheme one has to do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Optimize the geometry of the solute (anisole in this case) in vacuum. For a DFT calculation at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level of theory (with RIJCOSX), our input file would read like:</li>

<p>Here, ∆ G nel corresponds to Free-energy (cav+disp) and is calculated through eqs (2.57) and (2.58). The term called Surface-charge corresponds to the solute net charge that lies outside the C-PCM cavity. It is basically the sum of the C-PCM charges (without the scaling by f ( ε ) ). The effect of this excess of charge on the energy and the C-PCM charges themselves can be corrected by the so-called outlying charge correction. In ORCA, this correction is calculated through a Lagrangian-based algorithm,[156] but only printed for information purposes. That is, the outlying charge effect is neither added to the SCF energy nor to its derivatives. In any case, the corrected total charge is printed in Corrected charge , while the correction term for the energy is printed in Outlying charge corr. . To further help the user, ORCA also prints a file with extension .cpcm_corr , where the corrected C-PCM charges are provided.</p>
<p>If we want to use, instead, the GSES_nel model, one just needs to add surfacetype gepol_ses_gaussian in the %cpcm block.</p>
<p>Note: The analytical Hessian is not available for the GVDW_nel and GSES_nel models as the second derivative of ∆ G nel with respect to nuclear displacements is not implemented.</p>
<h2>Options for Computing the CPCM terms</h2>
<p>In CPCM calculations, there are three major steps. The first step is the calculation of the electrostatic potential created by the quantum object on the surface grid. This step is characterized by:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>The first sum is over atomic nuclei, the second over basis functions. The second step in the calculation consists of converting the surface potential into surface screening charges q . We are not writing it out here, since this step is slightly different for each variant of CPCM. In a nutshell, it involves solving a linear equation system of the dimension of the number of surface segments which is usually done by Cholesky decomposition.</p>
<p>The third, step is to sum the interaction of the surface charges with the quantum electrons into the Fock matrix. This step is given by:</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Here the sum is over surface segments with surface screening charges q g .</p>
<p>The time consuming step in these calculations is the calculation of the three-center electrostatic integrals ( µν | g ) . By default, these integrals are calculated using efficient analytic integration provided by SHARK. However, there are the following alternatives available:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1) ';">The integrals can be evaluated by numeric integration</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2) ';">The potential and Fock matrix contributions can be evaluated using the RI density and the RI approximation respectively</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3) ';">The potential and Fock matrix elements can be evaluated using multipole approximations to the integrals.</li>
</ol>
<p>These options are triggered by:</p>

<h2>2.13.3 The Conductor-like Screening Solvation Model (COSMO)</h2>
<h2>® Note</h2>
<p>The COSMO solvation model has been removed from ORCA v4.0.0 !!!</p>
<p>Please use the C-PCM solvation model in combination with the COSMO epsilon function if required!</p>
<p>As a short form to use the C-PCM model with the COSMO epsilon function, you can specify the solvent via</p>
<p>!CPCMC(solvent) .</p>
<h2>2.13.4 The SMD Solvation Model</h2>
<p>The SMD solvation model has been proposed by the Cramer and Truhlar groups,[141] and is based on the quantum mechanical charge density of a solute molecule interacting with a continuum description of the solvent. In the model the full solute electron density is used without defining partial atomic charges and the solvent is not represented explicitly but rather as a dielectric medium with the surface tension at the solute-solvent boundary. SMD is a universal solvation model, in the sense that it is applicable to any charged or uncharged solute in any solvent or liquid medium for which a few key descriptors are known. In particular, these descriptors are the dielectric constant, refractive index, bulk surface tension, and acidity and basicity parameters. Neglecting the concentration contribution, the model separates the observable solvation free energy into two main components,</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>In ORCA, the first component is the bulk electrostatic contribution arising from a self-consistent reaction field treatment that involves the electrostatic interaction using the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (C-PCM). However, the radii are set to 'intrinsic atomic Coulomb radii'. The second component, called the cavity-dispersion solvent-structure (CDS) term, is the contribution resulting from short-range interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in the first solvation shell. This contribution is a sum of terms that are proportional (with geometrydependent proportionality constants called atomic surface tensions) to the solvent-accessible surface areas of the</p>
<p>(continued from previous page)</p>
<p>individual atoms of the solute. The CDS contribution to the free energy of solvation is given by</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where σ k and σ [ M ] are the atomic surface tension of atom k and the molecular surface tension, respectively, and A k is the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). The SASA depends on the geometry R , the set R Z k of all atomic van der Waals radii, and the solvent radius r s , which is added to each of the atomic van der Waals radii. In the program Bondi radii are used for CDS contribution.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the original paper of Marenich et al. [141], which should be cited in publications using results of SMD calculations (together with ref. [140], describing the implementation of the C-PCM in ORCA, which is used by SMD).</p>
<p>SMD can be employed in single point calculations and geometry optimizations, using single-determinant SCF (HF and DFT) and CASSCF methods. In post-SCF methods the result is corrected in the reference wave function. The SMD solvation model is invoked in the input file via</p>
<pre><code>! SMD(solvent)</code></pre>
<p>where solvent is one of the 179 solvents in the SMD library (see Table Table 2.56). Alternatively, one can request the SMD model via the %cpcm block by writing:</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm smd true # turn on SMD SMDsolvent "solvent" # specify the name of solvent from the list end</code></pre>
<p>Independently on the way the user invokes the SMD model, ORCA automatically sets a number of default SMD parameters for the chosen solvent. If required, the user can also manually specify the solvent descriptors used in an SMD calculation in the %cpcm block.</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm soln # index of refraction at optical frequencies at 293 K soln25 # index of refraction at optical frequencies at 298 K sola # Abraham's hydrogen bond acidity solb # Abraham's hydrogen bond basicity solg # relative macroscopic surface tension solc # aromaticity, fraction of non-hydrogenic solvent atoms # that are aromatic carbon atoms solh # electronegative halogenicity, fraction of non-hydrogenic # solvent atoms that are F, Cl, or Br end</code></pre>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: '· ';">If one is interested in the calculation of free energies of solvation using the SMD model, one just needs to compute ∆ G S according to eq (2.59). However, here one should take into account that the SMD model considers the same concentration (1 mol/L) in both the gaseous and solution phases. Then, if a gas-phase standard state of 1 atm is considered, and we want to compare the calculated ∆ G S with its experimental counterpart, a concentration term equal to 1.89 kcal/mol has to be added to the calculated ∆ G S .</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.13.5 Dynamic Radii Adjustment for Continuum Solvation (DRACO)</h2>
<p>The DRACO scheme is an approach that improves the performance of implicit solvation models, in particular the accuracy of the calculated solvation free energies.[158] It is based on a dynamic scaling of the original static radii used to describe the atoms/spheres that define the cavity of the solute.</p>
<p>In this approach, the original radii r i of an atom i is scaled according to</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>with the scaling factor f i scale determined from</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>Here, q eff ,i corresponds to the effective partial charge and is defined as</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>where q i is the atomic partial charge. The parameters a Z , b Z and k Z are element-specific parameters, and CN i is the fractional coordination number.</p>
<p>For oxygen atoms, the f i scale is corrected via a term that depends on the Abraham's hydrogen bond acidity ( α ):</p>
<div class="formula-not-decoded">Formula not decoded</div>
<p>with c O a parameter that is different for pure C-PCM or SMD. The correction in eq (2.63) is only applied for solvents with α &lt; 0 . 43 .</p>
<p>DRACOis parametrized for C-PCM and SMD for the following solvents: acetonitrile, DMSO, methanol, and water. The element-specific parameters in eqs (2.61),(2.62), and (2.63) are available in https://github.com/grimme-lab/ DRACO.</p>
<p>The use of DRACO with C-PCM or SMD is triggered via the following tags in the simple input:</p>
<p>! CPCM(solvent) DRACO</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>! SMD(solvent) DRACO</p>
<p>Alternatively, it can also be requested in the %cpcm block:</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm DRACO true end</code></pre>
<p>In ORCA, the default scheme to calculate the partial charges in eq (2.62) is the electronegativity-equilibration (EEQ) charge model (D4 case),[159]. However, one can also request the Charge Extended Hückel (CEH) model.[160] The charge scheme within DRACO is controlled by the following tag in the %cpcm block:</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm draco_charges ceh # default = eeq end</code></pre>
<p>If CEH charges are requested, ORCA needs to run an XTB calculation to generate them. Here, one should have at least the version 6.7.1 of XTB (older versions will not generate the CEH charges, see section Program Components ). Regarding the fractional coordination number in eq (2.62), it is calculated as described in GFN2-XTB calculations.[161]</p>
<p>DRACOcanbeusedinsingle-point energy calculations (with both CEH and EEQ charges) and in geometry optimizations (with the EEQ charges)[162]. The DRACO contributions to the analytical Hessian are not yet implemented. In this case, the user should request numfreq .</p>
<p>Notice that calculations where DRACO is requested involve a discretization scheme of the surface of the cavity based on a constant number of charges per sphere. The default is 194 Lebedev points. This contrast with the scheme used for C-PCM/SMD calculations without DRACO, where the default is the isodensity scheme, as discussed in Section Use of the Gaussian Charge Scheme . This choice is needed, specially for geometry optimizations. For DRACO, the radii of the spheres in the cavity changes in each optimization step. Then, if ORCA used by default the isodensity scheme for DRACO, the associated Lebedev grid per atom could change between two consecutive steps, leading to discontinuities in the total energy and its gradient. Nevertheless, the isodensity scheme can still be requested for calculations involving DRACO via the tag DRACOisodens in the %cpcm block:</p>
<pre><code>%cpcm dracoisodens true # default = false end</code></pre>
<h2>2.13.6 OpenCOSMO-RS</h2>
<p>ORCAis interfaced to openCOSMO-RS,[142, 163] an open source implementation of the COSMO-RS model.[164, 165] This model is widely used in both academia and industry to predict fluid phase thermodynamics.</p>
<p>The main idea behind COSMO-RS is that the interaction between molecules in the liquid phase can de depicted as an ensemble of interacting surface segments. The properties on the surface segments are calculated via QM calculations of the solute and the solvent in a perfect conductor ( ϵ = ∞ ), and the interaction free energies between segments are functions of a set of descriptors. Among them, the most relevant one is the screening charge density ( σ ).</p>
<p>Acomplete description of the COSMO-RS model used in ORCA is provided in refs [142, 163], and the code is available in https://github.com/TUHH-TVT. In particular, the parametrization for ORCA 6.0 is called openCOSMO-RS 24a. The corresponding the executable is shipped together with the ORCA 6.0 binaries and called openCOSMORS . ORCA will then call internally this executable whenever it is needed.</p>
<p>COSMO-RS calculations within ORCA are a special type of calculation. By requesting COSMO-RS, ORCA runs a set of single-point-energy calculations for both the solute and the solvent and then calls the openCOSMO-RS executable, which expects an input geometry for the solute and the solvent and calculates the free energy of solvation of the solute in the solvent. A workflow of a calculation requesting COSMO-RS in ORCA is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Single-point-energy calculation of the solute in the gas-phase</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">Single-point-energy calculation of the solute in a conductor ( ϵ = ∞ )</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">Single-point-energy calculation of the solvent in a conductor ( ϵ = ∞ )</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '4. ';">Do COSMO-RS via the openCOSMO-RS executable and compute solvation properties</li>
</ol>
<p>Points 1 to 3 correspond to DFT calculations at the BP86/def2-TZVPD level. This is the level of theory used to parametrize COSMO-RS for ORCA 6.0. As it is shown later, the user can change the functional and basis set, but this is not recommended!</p>
